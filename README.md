# regex-project
Small, ongoing project to act as a guide for learning regular expressions.

Run locally with npm run dev and visit on the localhost address stated in the terminal (http://localhost:3000 by default)

Deployed to regex-tutor.vercel.app

Still needs at least dark mode - specific styling
